# Transcriptomics Databases and Transcript Abundance

## About this chapter

1.  Questions
    -   How can I use the ENA and NCBI to download sequence reads for transcripts?
    -   What is the overall pipeline for estimating abundance of transcripts?
    -   How can I annotate an assembled prokaryotic genome?
2.  Objectives
    -   Download some reads identified in ENA using efficient tools
    -   Run the tools needed to estimate transcript abundances
